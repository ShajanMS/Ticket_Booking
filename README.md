**Title :** **Automated Testing of the SpiceJet Flight Booking System**
**Test objective:** The goal of this project is to build a system that can automatically test the functionality of the SpiceJet flight booking system (https://www.spicejet.com/). The system will use Selenium, a tool for automating web browsers, to navigate through the website and perform various actions, such as searching for flights and booking tickets. The system will then verify that the flight booking system is functioning correctly by checking the resulting web pages for expected content and behavior.
